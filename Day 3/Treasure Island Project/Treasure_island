#Treasure Island Adventure game

A fun interactive Python game where your mission is to find the hidden treasure!  
This was built as part of my "Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp".

* How to Play
- You'll be prompted to make choices like going "left" or "right".
- Survive each level without falling into traps.
- Choose the correct door at the end to win the treasure!

* What I Practiced
- Using input() and .lower() for case-insensitive decisions
- Nested if-else statements
- Logical game flow design
- Printing multiline ASCII art and messages

* File Included
- task.py – The full game logic
