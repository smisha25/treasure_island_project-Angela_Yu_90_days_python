# Rock Paper Scissors game

it's a simple Python-based implementation of the classic "rock, paper, scissors" game.
This is part of my "100 days of code" journey!!

*So this is how it works
--you enter a number to choose between rock, paper and scissors as instructed.
--The computer picks randomly.
--It prints out who wins based on the game rules.

*What I gained from this
-- Using 'random.randint()'
-- Working with lists.
-- Basic terminal input and output.
