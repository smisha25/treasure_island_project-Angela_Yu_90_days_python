# Rock Paper Scissors game

it's a simple Python-based implementation of the classic "rock, paper, scissors" game.
This is part of my "100 days of code" journey!!

*So this is how it works
--you enter a number to choose between rock, paper and scissors as instructed.
--The computer picks randomly.
--It prints out who wins based on the game rules.

*What I gained from this
-- Using 'random.randint()'
-- Working with lists.
-- Basic terminal input and output.





#Treasure Island Adventure game

A fun interactive Python game where your mission is to find the hidden treasure!  
This was built as part of my "Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp".

* How to Play
- You'll be prompted to make choices like going "left" or "right".
- Survive each level without falling into traps.
- Choose the correct door at the end to win the treasure!

* What I Practiced
- Using input() and .lower() for case-insensitive decisions
- Nested if-else statements
- Logical game flow design
- Printing multiline ASCII art and messages
